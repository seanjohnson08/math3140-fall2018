# Math 3140 Fall 2018 Schedule

This is the preliminary schedule for Math 3140.
It will be updated frequently throughout the semester, and students 
should refer to this page often.

All chapters and sections and exercise numbers refer to  those in the book "Abstract Algebra: theory and applications" by Judson (August 1, 2018 edition).

You need not submit solutions to exercises marked "suggested."

(The exercise numbers in the assignments listed below were originally chosen while using an earlier edition of the textbook.  I will revise these numbers as necessary to match the appropriate exercise in the latest edition of the book, but please be aware that mistakes may occur;  if in doubt, plesae post a question on Piazza.)
