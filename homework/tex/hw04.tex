\item[{\bf 16.}]
Give a specific example of a group $G$ and elements $g, h \in G$ where $(gh)^n \neq g^nh^n$. 

\textbf{Answer:} An example of such a group is the symmetric group $S_3$ (the group of all permutations of three elements). If we let $g = (12)$ and $h = (23)$, then $(gh)^2 = (123)$ while $g^2h^2 = e$, the identity element. Therefore, $(gh)^n \neq g^nh^n$ for $n=2$.
