\begin{enumerate}[{\bf 1.}]

%% 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item %1
Let $P$ with $\leq$ be a partially ordered set, let $S \subseteq P$ and let
$u\in P$.  We say that $u$ is an \emph{upper bound} for $S$ iff $s\leq u$ for
all $s \in S$.  We say $\ell$ is the \emph{least upper bound} of $S$ iff $\ell$
is an upper bound of $S$ and $\ell \leq u$ for every upper bound $u$ of $S$.
Prove that if $\ell$ is the least upper bound of the set $\{x, y\}$ and $m$ is
the least upper bound of the set $\{\ell, z\}$, then $m$ is the least upper
bound of the set $\{x, y, z\}$.

%% 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item
Let $(P, \leq)$ be a partially ordered set with the property that every pair of
elements $x, y \in P$ has a greatest lower bound. For $x, y\in P$, define 
$x \cdot y = \operatorname{glb}(x,y)$. Prove that $(P, \cdot)$ is a semilattice.

%% Let S with · be a semilattice. For x, y ∈ S we say x ≤ y iff x · y = y. Prove that ≤ is a partial ordering on S. Also prove that x · y is the least upper bound of the set {x, y}.

%% 3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 19.3.}] 
Draw a diagram of the lattice of subgroups of ${\mathbb Z}_{12}$.

%% 14 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 19.13.}] 
Let $G$ be a group and $X$ be the set of subgroups of $G$ ordered by
set-theoretic inclusion. If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of $G$, show
that the least upper bound of $H$ and $K$ is the subgroup generated by
$H \cup K$.

%% 20 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 19.19.}] 
Let $X$ and $Y$ be posets.  A map $\phi : X \rightarrow Y$ is \boldemph{
order-preserving} if $a \preceq b$
implies that $\phi(a) \preceq \phi(b)$.  Let $L$ and $M$ be lattices.
A map $\psi: L \rightarrow M$ is a \boldemph{lattice
homomorphism}
if $\psi( a \vee b ) = \psi(a) \vee \psi(b)$ and $\psi( a \wedge b ) =
\psi(a) \wedge \psi(b)$. Show that every lattice homomorphism is
order-preserving, but that it is not the case that every
order-preserving map is a lattice homomorphism.
