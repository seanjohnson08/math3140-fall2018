Recall, if $G$ acts on a set $X$ and $x, y \in X$, then $x$ is said
to be \boldemph{$G$-equivalent} to $y$ if there exists a $g \in G$ such that 
$gx =y$. We  write $x \sim_G y$ or $x \sim y$ if $x$ and $y$ are $G$-equivalent. 
In class, we proved that the $G$-equivalence relation is reflexive and
symmetric. You should check the transitive property on your own to complete the
proof that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$. 
 
%% \noindent {\bf Exercises:}
\begin{enumerate}
%% 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf 14.1}] Each of the examples below describes an action of a group $G$
  on a set $X$, which will give rise to the equivalence relation defined by
  $G$-equivalence.  For each example, compute the equivalence classes of the
  $G$-equivalence relation.  
 
%% {\bf Examples:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
%\begin{example}{D4_action}
Let $G = D_4$ be the symmetry group of a square.  If $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}$ is the set of vertices of the square, then we can consider $D_4$
to consist of the following permutations: 
\[\{ (1), (13), (24), (1432), (1234), (12)(34), (14)(23), (13)(24) \}.\]
The elements of $D_4$ act on $X$ as functions.  The permutation $(13)(24)$ acts on vertex 1 by sending it to vertex 3, on vertex 2 by
sending it to vertex 4, and so on.

\smallskip

\item 
If we let $X = G$, then every group $G$ acts on itself by the so called 
\emph{left regular representation} $\lambda: G \rightarrow \Sym(G)$ which, for
each $g\in G$, gives the function $\lambda_g: G\rightarrow G$ 
defined by $\lambda_g(x) = gx$. That is, $G$
itself is a $G$-set under this ``left multiplication'' action.
%% \begin{gather*}
%% e \cdot x = \lambda_e x = ex = x \\
%% (gh) \cdot x = \lambda_{gh}x = \lambda_g \lambda_h x =
%% \lambda_g(hx) = g \cdot ( h \cdot x).
%% \end{gather*}
Alternatively, we could restrict the domain of $\lambda$ to a particular
subgroup, say, $H\leq G$, and then $G$ becomes an $H$-set under left 
multiplication by elements of $H$. 
%% \end{example}
 
\smallskip 

 
\item
%% \begin{example}{conj_action}
Let $G$ be a group and suppose that $X=G$. If $H$ is a subgroup of
$G$, then $G$ is an $H$-set under 
the \emph{conjugation action}; that is, we can define an action 
$\varphi$ of $H$ on $G$ with the function 
$\varphi: H \rightarrow (G \rightarrow G)$ where 
$\varphi_h(g) = hgh^{-1}$.
%% Alternatively, viewing the action as a function of two variables, we have
%% \[
%% \varphi: H \times G \rightarrow G
%% \quad \text{ via } \quad
%% \varphi(h,g)= hgh^{-1}
%% \]
%% for $h \in H$ and $g \in G$.%%   Clearly, the first axiom for a group
%% action holds.  Observing that 
%% \begin{align*}
%% (h_1 h_2, g) 
%% & = h_1 h_2 g (h_1 h_2 )^{-1} \\
%% & = h_1( h_2 g h_2^{-1}) h_1^{-1} \\
%% & =  (h_1, (h_2, g) ),
%% \end{align*}
%% we see that the second condition is also satisfied.
%% %% \end{example}
 
\smallskip 

 
\item
%% \begin{example}{left_coset_action}
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and let $G/H$ denote the set of left cosets
of $H$.  The set $G/H$ is a $G$-set under the action
$\lambda: G \rightarrow (G/H \rightarrow G/H)$ given by 
$\lambda_g(xH) = gxH$.%%   That is,
%% $\lambda: G \times G/H \mapsto G/H$ given by 
%% $\lambda(g, xH) = gxH$.
%% \]
%% That is, for each $g$, for each $xH \in G/H$, we have $\lambda_g(xH) = gxH.$
%% Again, it is easy to see that the first axiom is true. Since $(g g')xH
%% = g( g'x H)$, the second axiom is  also true.
%% \end{example}
