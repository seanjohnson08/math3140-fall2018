Certainly! Here are the answers to the homework questions:

1. The subgroup generated by $\{4, 6\}$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is $\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$.

2. The subgroup $H = \{e, (1,2,3), (1,3,2)\}$ of $A_4$ can be generated by either $(1,2,3)$ or $(1,3,2)$.

3. The subgroup $H$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ generated by $\{4, 6\}$ is $\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$.

4. If $G = \langle a \rangle$ is a cyclic group and $x = a^6$ and $y = a^8$, then $H = \langle x, y \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle$.

5. The group $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ is not cyclic and requires at least two elements to generate it. One possible set of generators is $\{(0,1), (1,1)\}$.

6. The Klein 4 group $V_4$ is a two-generated subgroup of $A_4$. It can be generated by any pair of non-identity elements, such as $(1,2)(3,4)$ and $(1,3)(2,4)$. Another possible set of generators is $(1,3)(2,4)$ and $(1,4)(2,3)$. The Klein 4 group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
