## Math 3140 Conventions

Here is a list of some conventions used in this class that differ from the conventions used in our textbook.

1. We will take **set theory** to be our foundation for mathematics; as such, every mathematical object is defined as a certain **set**.

2. We define the **natural numbers** constructively as follows (see also ConstructingTheNaturalNumbers.pdf, an excerpt from Enderton's book on set theory): the symbols 0, 1, 2, …, refer to the *sets* ∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}, {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}}, etc.  More simply, we define the following sets: 0 := ∅ (the *empty* set, which has no elements), 1 := {0} (the set containing the empty set), 2 := {0, 1}, …, n := {0, 1, …, n-1}.  (Contrast this with the convention used in our textbook which omits 0 from the set of natural numbers.
